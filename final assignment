Define Graphing Function
In this section, we define the function make_graph. You don't have to know how the function works, you should only care about the inputs. It takes a dataframe with stock data (dataframe must contain Date and Close columns), a dataframe with revenue data (dataframe must contain Date and Revenue columns), and the name of the stock.

def make_graph(stock_data, revenue_data, stock):
    fig = make_subplots(rows=2, cols=1, shared_xaxes=True, subplot_titles=("Historical Share Price", "Historical Revenue"), vertical_spacing = .3)
    stock_data_specific = stock_data[stock_data.Date <= '2021--06-14']
    revenue_data_specific = revenue_data[revenue_data.Date <= '2021-04-30']
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=pd.to_datetime(stock_data_specific.Date, infer_datetime_format=True), y=stock_data_specific.Close.astype("float"), name="Share Price"), row=1, col=1)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=pd.to_datetime(revenue_data_specific.Date, infer_datetime_format=True), y=revenue_data_specific.Revenue.astype("float"), name="Revenue"), row=2, col=1)
    fig.update_xaxes(title_text="Date", row=1, col=1)
    fig.update_xaxes(title_text="Date", row=2, col=1)
    fig.update_yaxes(title_text="Price ($US)", row=1, col=1)
    fig.update_yaxes(title_text="Revenue ($US Millions)", row=2, col=1)
    fig.update_layout(showlegend=False,
    height=900,
    title=stock,
    xaxis_rangeslider_visible=True)
    fig.show()
Question 1: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
Using the Ticker function enter the ticker symbol of the stock we want to extract data on to create a ticker object. The stock is Tesla and its ticker symbol is TSLA.

Tesla = yf.Ticker("TSLA")
Using the ticker object and the function history extract stock information and save it in a dataframe named tesla_data. Set the period parameter to max so we get information for the maximum amount of time.

tesla_data = Tesla.history(period="max")
Reset the index using the reset_index(inplace=True) function on the tesla_data DataFrame and display the first five rows of the tesla_data dataframe using the head function. Take a screenshot of the results and code from the beginning of Question 1 to the results below.

tesla_data.reset_index(inplace=True)

tesla_data.head()
Date	Open	High	Low	Close	Volume	Dividends	Stock Splits
0	2010-06-29	1.266667	1.666667	1.169333	1.592667	281494500	0	0.0

Question 2: Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data
Use the requests library to download the webpage https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/revenue.htm Save the text of the response as a variable named html_data.

url = " https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/revenue.htm"

html_data = requests.get(url).text
Parse the html data using beautiful_soup.

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_data, "html.parser")
soup.find_all('title')
[<title>Tesla Revenue 2010-2022 | TSLA | MacroTrends</title>]
Using BeautifulSoup or the read_html function extract the table with Tesla Quarterly Revenue and store it into a dataframe named tesla_revenue. The dataframe should have columns Date and Revenue.

Click here if you need help locating the table
    
Below is the code to isolate the table, you will now need to loop through the rows and columns like in the previous lab
    
soup.find_all("tbody")[1]
    
If you want to use the read_html function the table is located at index 1


tesla_revenue = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['Date', 'Revenue'])

for row in soup.find_all("tbody")[1].find_all("tr"):
    col = row.find_all("td")
    date = col[0].text
    revenue = col[1].text.replace("$", "").replace(",", "")
    
    tesla_revenue = tesla_revenue.append({"Date": date, "Revenue": revenue}, ignore_index = True)
Execute the following line to remove the comma and dollar sign from the Revenue column.

revenue = col[1].text.replace("$", "").replace(",", "")
Execute the following lines to remove an null or empty strings in the Revenue column.

tesla_revenue.dropna(inplace=True)
tesla_revenue = tesla_revenue[tesla_revenue['Revenue'] != ""]
Display the last 5 row of the tesla_revenue dataframe using the tail function. Take a screenshot of the results.

tesla_revenue.tail()
Date	Revenue
48	2010-09-30	31
49	2010-06-30	28
50	2010-03-31	21
52	2009-09-30	46
53	2009-06-30	27
Question 3: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
Using the Ticker function enter the ticker symbol of the stock we want to extract data on to create a ticker object. The stock is GameStop and its ticker symbol is GME.

Game_stop = yf.Ticker("GME")
Using the ticker object and the function history extract stock information and save it in a dataframe named gme_data. Set the period parameter to max so we get information for the maximum amount of time.

gme_data = Game_stop.history(period = "max")
Reset the index using the reset_index(inplace=True) function on the gme_data DataFrame and display the first five rows of the gme_data dataframe using the head function. Take a screenshot of the results and code from the beginning of Question 3 to the results below.

gme_data.reset_index(inplace=True)
gme_data.head()
Date	Open	High	Low	Close	Volume	Dividends	Stock Splits
0	2002-02-13	1.620128	1.693349	1.603295	1.691666	76216000	0.0	0.0

Question 4: Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data
Use the requests library to download the webpage https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html. Save the text of the response as a variable named html_data.

url = " https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0220EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/project/stock.html"

html_data = requests.get(url).text
Parse the html data using beautiful_soup.

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_data , "html.parser")
soup.find_all('title')
[<title>GameStop Revenue 2006-2020 | GME | MacroTrends</title>]
Using BeautifulSoup or the read_html function extract the table with GameStop Quarterly Revenue and store it into a dataframe named gme_revenue. The dataframe should have columns Date and Revenue. Make sure the comma and dollar sign is removed from the Revenue column using a method similar to what you did in Question 2.

Click here if you need help locating the table
    
Below is the code to isolate the table, you will now need to loop through the rows and columns like in the previous lab
    
soup.find_all("tbody")[1]

gme_revenue = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['Date', 'Revenue'])

for row in soup.find_all("tbody")[1].find_all("tr"):
    col = row.find_all("td")
    date = col[0].text
    revenue = col[1].text.replace("$", "").replace(",", "")
    
    gme_revenue = gme_revenue.append({"Date": date, "Revenue": revenue}, ignore_index = True)
Display the last five rows of the gme_revenue dataframe using the tail function. Take a screenshot of the results.

gme_revenue.tail()
Date	Revenue
57	2006-01-31	1667
58	2005-10-31	534
59	2005-07-31	416
60	2005-04-30	475
61	2005-01-31	709
Question 5: Plot Tesla Stock Graph
Use the make_graph function to graph the Tesla Stock Data, also provide a title for the graph. The structure to call the make_graph function is make_graph(tesla_data, tesla_revenue, 'Tesla'). Note the graph will only show data upto June 2021.

make_graph(tesla_data, tesla_revenue, 'Tesla')
Question 6: Plot GameStop Stock Graph
Use the make_graph function to graph the GameStop Stock Data, also provide a title for the graph. The structure to call the make_graph function is make_graph(gme_data, gme_revenue, 'GameStop'). Note the graph will only show data upto June 2021.

make_graph(gme_data, gme_revenue, 'GameStop')
